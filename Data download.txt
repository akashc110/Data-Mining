We chose sp500 as our index and selected the top six stocks from it weighted by market capitalization.
Our goal is to replicate the index by selecting a few stocks and calculating the log returns.

So we used the hist.get.quote() function from the tseries R package.
We chose the period from 1st Jan 2009 to 31st Dec 2015.
Since we downloaded monthly data, we got 84 observations in all.
From those 84 observations we calculated the monthly returns and we got 83 monthly returns.
